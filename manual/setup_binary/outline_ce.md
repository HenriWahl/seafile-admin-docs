# Deploying Seafile

We provide two ways to deploy Seafile services. **Docker is the recommended way**. Since version 12.0, binary based deployment for community edition is deprecated and will not be supported in a future release.

* Using [Docker](../setup/setup_ce_by_docker.md)
* Manually installing Seafile and setting up database, memcached and Nginx/Apache. See the following section.

## Manually deployment options

* [Deploying Seafile with MySQL](installation_ce.md)
* Deploying Seafile with SQLite, note, deploy Seafile with SQLite is not supported since version 11.0
* [Enabling Https with Nginx](https_with_nginx.md)
* [Enabling Https with Apache](https_with_apache.md)
* [Start Seafile at System Bootup](start_seafile_at_system_bootup.md)
* [Logrotate](using_logrotate.md)
